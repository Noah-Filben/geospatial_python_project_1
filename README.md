# geospatial_python_project_1
Downloaded a geoJSON zipcode file as well as a Short Term Rental csv from Nashville's public data website \
Utilized pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, & folium to clean, analyze & ultimately turn the csv into a geodataframe \
and later turn the data into a clustered folium map to show density of short term rentals (airbnb & other services) by zip code in Nashville.
